# BuffPower Performance Optimization Plan (Inspired by PallyPower)

This plan outlines strategies to optimize BuffPower's performance, drawing inspiration from the efficient PallyPower addon. The primary goal is to reduce CPU load by throttling event handling, UI updates, and communication.

## Core Libraries to Leverage:
*   **AceBucket-3.0:** For throttling frequent game events.
*   **AceTimer-3.0:** For scheduling periodic UI updates and delayed actions.
*   **AceComm-3.0 (ChatThrottleLib):** For managing addon communication efficiently.

## Key Optimization Strategies:

### 1. Implement Event Bucketing (`AceBucket-3.0`) - Highest Priority

*   **Objective:** Prevent `BuffPower` from reacting to every single instance of high-frequency events like `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE` and `UNIT_AURA`.
*   **Action:**
    *   Register `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE`, `UNIT_AURA`, and potentially other relevant frequent events (e.g., `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED`, `UNIT_PET`) to an `AceBucket-3.0` event handler.
    *   This bucket should call a new core data update function, for example, `BuffPower:DebouncedCoreUpdate()`, no more than once every **0.75 to 1 second**.
*   **`BuffPower:DebouncedCoreUpdate()` Functionality:**
    *   Perform necessary roster scanning (e.g., `GetNumGroupMembers`, iterate members, check class/name).
    *   Update `BuffPower`'s internal data structures representing the raid composition and basic player states.
    *   If the roster structure has changed significantly (members joined/left, major status changes), it can then call a function to update the main UI layout (e.g., `BuffPower:RebuildUILayout()`).
    *   This function should *not* iterate through all buffs for all players. It primarily updates the roster and signals that a more detailed UI refresh might be needed.

### 2. Implement Timed UI Visual Updates (`AceTimer-3.0`)

*   **Objective:** Decouple detailed UI visual updates (buff icons, timers, colors) from direct event triggers.
*   **Action:**
    *   Create a new function, for example, `BuffPower:RefreshUIVisuals()`.
    *   This function will be responsible for iterating through the visible UI elements for each player/group.
*   **`BuffPower:RefreshUIVisuals()` Functionality:**
    *   For each player represented in the UI:
        *   Check their current buffs using `UnitAura` (or the existing buff checking logic).
        *   Update their specific UI element's icon, color, timer text, and other visual indicators based on their current buff status and assignments.
*   **Scheduling:**
    *   Schedule `BuffPower:RefreshUIVisuals` using `self:ScheduleRepeatingTimer(self.RefreshUIVisuals, 1, self)`. This will run the visual refresh once per second.
    *   The timer (`self.uiRefreshTimer`) should only be active if the BuffPower UI is shown and there are active assignments or states to monitor.
    *   Cancel this timer (`self:CancelTimer(self.uiRefreshTimer)`) when the UI is hidden or no dynamic updates are needed to save resources.

### 3. Throttle and Delay Addon Communication (`AceComm-3.0` & `AceTimer-3.0`)

*   **Objective:** Prevent spamming addon messages and allow for user input to settle before broadcasting changes.
*   **Action:**
    *   Ensure `AceComm-3.0` is used for all addon messages, leveraging its underlying `ChatThrottleLib`.
    *   When a buff assignment is changed via the BuffPower UI (e.g., clicking a buff button for a player):
        *   Instead of sending the message immediately, use `self:ScheduleTimer(delay, functionToSendMessage)` with a short delay (e.g., **0.5 to 1.0 seconds**).
        *   Store the handle to this timer. If another UI change that would trigger a message occurs *before* this timer fires, cancel the existing timer (`self:CancelTimer(previousTimerHandle)`) and schedule a new one for the latest change. This implements a debouncing mechanism.
    *   Consider a mechanism similar to `PallyPower`'s `lastMsg` check to avoid sending identical consecutive messages.

### 4. Refine `UNIT_AURA` Interaction

*   **Objective:** Minimize direct, intensive processing in response to every `UNIT_AURA` event.
*   **Action:**
    *   The primary, detailed interaction with `UnitAura` (or `UnitBuff`) for checking specific buffs on players should occur within the timed `BuffPower:RefreshUIVisuals()` function.
    *   When the bucketed `BuffPower:DebouncedCoreUpdate()` is triggered by a `UNIT_AURA` event, its main role is to acknowledge that *some* aura changed. It might set a flag indicating that the next `RefreshUIVisuals` cycle should be particularly thorough, or simply rely on the regular 1-second `RefreshUIVisuals` to catch the change. It should *not* re-scan all buffs on all players immediately.

## Implementation Steps:

1.  **Integrate `AceBucket-3.0`:**
    *   Add `AceBucket-3.0` to the `.toc` file and addon embedding.
    *   Modify event registration in `OnEnable` to use `RegisterBucketEvent` for `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE`, `UNIT_AURA`, etc., pointing to `BuffPower:DebouncedCoreUpdate`.
    *   Implement `BuffPower:DebouncedCoreUpdate` to handle roster data.
2.  **Integrate `AceTimer-3.0` for UI Refresh:**
    *   Implement `BuffPower:RefreshUIVisuals` to contain the logic for checking buffs and updating UI elements' appearance.
    *   In `OnEnable` (or when the UI is shown), schedule `RefreshUIVisuals` using `ScheduleRepeatingTimer`.
    *   In `OnDisable` (or when the UI is hidden), cancel this timer.
3.  **Refactor Communication:**
    *   Review all `C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage` calls.
    *   Wrap them in functions that use `self:ScheduleTimer` for delayed/debounced sending when triggered by UI interactions.
4.  **Test and Profile:**
    *   Thoroughly test in various group sizes and combat scenarios.
    *   Use the WoW Addon CPU Profiler to measure improvements and identify any remaining bottlenecks.

By adopting these strategies, `BuffPower` should see a significant reduction in CPU usage, leading to a much smoother experience for users, similar to the performance observed in `PallyPower`.
